This website contains a series of lectures on genetic data analysis,
taught by [David Gerard](https://dcgerard.github.io/), at his research
group meetings during the 2021–2022 academic year.

Topics include

-   The first three chapters from Weir (1996), covering frequency
    estimation, Hardy-Weinberg testing, and LD estimation and testing
    from a statistical point of view.

-   Chapters 1, 2, and 5 from Gillespie (2004), covering Hardy-Weinberg,
    genetic drift, mutation, and non-random mating.

-   An introduction to the EM algorithm, with an application from H. Li
    (2011).

-   An introduction to Bayesian inference.

-   A discussion of N. Li and Stephens (2003).
