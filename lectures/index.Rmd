## Synopsis

This website contains a series of lectures on genetic data analysis, taught by [David Gerard](https://dcgerard.github.io/), at his research group meetings during the 2021--2022 academic year.

Topics include

- The first three chapters from @weir1996genetic, covering frequency estimation, Hardy-Weinberg testing, and LD estimation and testing from a statistical point of view.

- Chapters 1, 2, and 5 from @gillespie2004population, covering Hardy-Weinberg, genetic drift, and non-random mating.

- An introduction to the EM algorithm, with its application that of @li2011statistical.

- A discussion of @li2003modeling.
